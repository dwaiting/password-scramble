# Password Scramble

This is an HTML game that I created for a company-wide cyber-security game competition in 2015. It didn't win.

But you can still play it here!

In this game, you use the mine cart to collect falling characters and make a secure password. At some point the Password Cracker 2000 will start brute force cracking your password. The PC2000 starts with lower case alphabet, then tries the upper case alphabet, and finally special characters, e.g. #, !, (. Therefore, lower case characters take the shortest amount of time to crack and special characters take the longest.

Your goal is to complete your password before the PC2000 cracks it. Good luck!
